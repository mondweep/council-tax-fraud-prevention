# Council Tax Fraud Prevention System: AI-Powered Detection Platform
## Case Study for UK Local Authorities

---

### Executive Summary

The Council Tax Fraud Prevention System represents a breakthrough in automated fraud detection for UK local authorities, combining advanced AI algorithms with intelligent risk assessment to significantly reduce revenue loss while maintaining fairness and accuracy in fraud identification.

---

## Problem Statement

### The Challenge
UK local authorities lose an estimated **£2.4 billion annually** to council tax fraud, representing approximately 15% of total council tax revenue. Traditional manual review processes are resource-intensive, inconsistent, and struggle to differentiate between genuine errors and deliberate fraud attempts.

### Key Pain Points
- **Revenue Loss**: Systematic fraud schemes cost authorities £50,000-£500,000 annually per authority
- **Resource Drain**: Manual case reviews consume 60-80% of compliance team capacity
- **Inconsistent Detection**: Human reviewers achieve only 45-65% accuracy in fraud classification
- **Vulnerable Residents**: Sophisticated schemes like "cuckooing" exploit vulnerable individuals while evading detection
- **False Positives**: Over-aggressive manual screening creates 40-50% false positive rates, damaging resident relationships

### Specific Fraud Types Identified
1. **Single Person Discount Fraud** (35% of fraud cases)
2. **Student Exemption Fraud** (25% of fraud cases)
3. **Empty Property Fraud** (20% of fraud cases)
4. **Cuckooing & Criminal Exploitation** (10% of fraud cases)
5. **Property Banding Disputes** (7% of fraud cases)
6. **Council Tax Reduction Fraud** (3% of fraud cases)
