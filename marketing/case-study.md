## Problem Statement

### The Challenge
UK local authorities face significant challenges with council tax fraud, with estimates suggesting losses in the billions annually. Traditional manual review processes are resource-intensive, inconsistent, and struggle to differentiate between genuine errors and deliberate fraud attempts effectively.

### Key Pain Points
- **Revenue Loss**: Fraud schemes can cost individual authorities significant sums annually
- **Resource Drain**: Manual case reviews consume substantial compliance team capacity
- **Inconsistent Detection**: Human reviewers face challenges in maintaining consistent fraud classification accuracy
- **Vulnerable Residents**: Sophisticated schemes like "cuckooing" exploit vulnerable individuals whilst often evading detection
- **False Positives**: Aggressive manual screening can create high false positive rates, potentially damaging resident relationships

### Specific Fraud Types Explored
1. **Single Person Discount Fraud** (commonly reported fraud type)
2. **Student Exemption Fraud** (significant in university areas)
3. **Empty Property Fraud** (challenging to verify)
4. **Cuckooing & Criminal Exploitation** (requires sensitive handling)
5. **Property Banding Disputes** (technical assessment challenges)
6. **Council Tax Reduction Fraud** (complex eligibility criteria)

## Conclusion

This Council Tax Fraud Prevention System prototype demonstrates the potential for responsible AI application in public service delivery. Rather than promising revolutionary change, it invites exploration of how technology might support existing processes whilst maintaining human oversight and ethical standards.

The demonstrated approach suggests opportunities for gradual improvement in fraud detection capabilities, but any implementation would require careful validation through controlled pilots, comprehensive staff training, and ongoing performance monitoring.

We encourage local authorities to consider this as a starting point for discussion about innovative approaches to revenue protection, always balancing technological capability with the need for fairness, transparency, and resident protection.
